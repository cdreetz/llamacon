    "chosen": "Here is the code for a function that calculates Fibonacci numbers. The function uses memoization to optimize the computation for larger inputs.\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n, memo={}):\n    # Base cases\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Check if the result is already in the memo\n    elif n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    # Compute the result and store it in the memo\n    else:\n        result = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)\n        memo[n] = result\n        return result\n\n# Test the function\nprint(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55\n```            \n            This code defines a function `fibonacci(n, memo={})` that takes an integer `n` and an optional dictionary `memo` as arguments. The function uses memoization to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers in the `memo` dictionary. If the Fibonacci number for `n` is already in the `memo`, it returns the stored result. Otherwise, it computes the result recursively and stores it in the `memo` before returning it. The function handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, in which case it returns 0 or 1, respectively. The function is tested with the example input `n = 10`, which prints the result `55`. \n            The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it performs a constant amount of work for each recursive call. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage required for the memo dictionary."

You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n            \u00a0\n```bash\npip install requests beautifulsoup4\n```\n            \u00a0\n            Now, let's create a simple web scraper that extracts the title of a webpage. We will use the `requests` library to send an HTTP request to the webpage and the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML content of the webpage.\n            \u00a0\n```python\n# Import the required libraries\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Define the URL of the webpage\nurl = \"http://www.example.com\"\n\n# Send an HTTP request to the webpage\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\n# Check if the request was successful\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    # Parse the HTML content of the webpage using BeautifulSoup\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, \"html.parser\")\n\n    # Extract the title of the webpage\n    title = soup.title.text\n\n    # Print the title of the webpage\n    print(title)\nelse:\n    # Print an error message if the request was not successful\n    print(\"Failed to retrieve the webpage\")\n```\n            \u00a0\n            In this code, we first import the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. We then define the URL of the webpage that we want to scrape. We send an HTTP request to the webpage using the `requests.get()` method and store the response in the `response` variable. We then check if the request was successful by checking the status code of the response. If the request was successful, we parse the HTML content of the webpage using the `BeautifulSoup()` method and extract the title of the webpage using the `title.text` attribute. Finally, we print the title of the webpage.\n            \u00a0\n            This is a very basic example of a web scraper and you can modify it to extract more information from the webpage. You can also use this code as a starting point to build more complex web scrapers.\n            \u00a0\n            Here are some additional comments to explain the code:\n            \u00a0\n```python\n# This is the main function of the program\ndef main():\n    # Define the URL of the webpage\n    url = \"http://www.example.com\"\n\n    # Send an HTTP request to the webpage\n    response = requests.get(url)\n\n    # Check if the request was successful",

It includes a check to ensure that the GET request is successful before attempting to parse the HTML content. The code also includes a comment to explain the purpose of each section of the code.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas for improvement:\n\n1. Error handling: The code does not include any error handling for the `requests.get()` function. If the GET request fails, the code will crash with an exception. You should add try-except blocks to handle any exceptions that may be raised.\n\n2. URL validation: The code does not validate the URL before sending the GET request. You should add a check to ensure that the URL is valid before attempting to send the GET request.\n\n3. User agent: The"
